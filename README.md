# salaustesti
A login / administrator login program written in Python as an exercise and for fun.

You can log in as a user (option 1) or as an administrator (option 2). Admin can create users and set their passwords. 

On creating user two files are created:
1. {username}.txt, where the encrypted password is stored and
2. {username}synty.txt, where the users birthday is stored in plain text. 

Upon creating the user, the birthday is multiplied by the user-set password and encrypted according to the values set in the dictionary "salaKirja". At login, the birthday is read from the file and the process is the same. The encrypted passwords are then compared.

If the username and password are valid, one-time passcode is generated by the "authenticator" function. Atm the passcode is printed on screen (for testing purposes), but in future it will be sent by email/Telegram/whatever is the best option.

You can create a new admin password by uncommenting the lines after the dictionary and running the program.

Comments only in finnish atm, sorry.
